    <div class="biography">
        <p>Tracy Lamar McGrady Jr. (born May 24, 1979) is an American former professional basketball player, best known
            for
            his career in the National Basketball Association (NBA).
            McGrady is a seven-time NBA All-Star, seven-time All-NBA selection, two-time NBA scoring champion, and
            winner of
            the NBA Most Improved Player Award in 2001.
        </p>

        <p> Tracy McGrady was selected as the ninth overall pick by the Toronto Raptors in the 1997 NBA draft. Then he
            went to
            the Orlando Magic where he was voted
            the league's Most Improved Player in 2000. Undoubtedly at that time it was his prime for his career.</p>

        <p>
            Tracy was traded to Houston Rockets in 2004. The Rockets struggled to begin the 2004–05 season, posting a
            losing record of 16–17 through their first 33 games.[35] In December, McGrady had one of the most memorable
            performances of his career, scoring 13 points in the final 35 seconds against the San Antonio Spurs to
            secure a comeback victory. The sequence included four consecutive three-pointers,
            one of which was part of a four-point play and the last of which was a game-winner in the final two seconds.

            However, during 2005-2010, Tracy had missed more than 50 games because of back spasms, left shoulder and
            knee injuries.

            went on a 22-game winning streak, which was the then-second longest in NBA history, despite missing Yao Ming
            during that stretch.[46] During their run,
            McGrady expressed optimism over the team's roster, admitting, "I haven't had this kind of trust in my
            teammates before."
